## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and Navigate**
   ```bash
   # Already in Replit - both frontend and backend are running
   ```

2. **Access the Application**
   - **Frontend**: Port 5000 (React/TypeScript UI)
   - **Backend API**: Port 8000 (FastAPI with AI services)
   - **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs

3. **Core Features Working**
   - ✅ Modern React frontend with shadcn/ui components
   - ✅ FastAPI backend with SQLite database
   - ✅ ChromaDB vector storage for question similarity
   - ✅ AI evaluation with Groq/OpenAI integration (mock fallbacks)
   - ✅ Real-time interview state management

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for development and building
- **shadcn/ui** for modern UI components
- **React Router** for navigation
- **TanStack Query** for API state management

### Backend  
- **FastAPI** for high-performance API
- **SQLAlchemy** with SQLite for development
- **ChromaDB** for vector embeddings and similarity search
- **Groq** for fast LLM inference (with OpenAI fallback)
- **Redis** for session management (optional)

### AI/ML Stack
- **LangChain** for LLM orchestration
- **ChromaDB** for vector storage and retrieval
- **Groq API** for real-time AI evaluation
- **Template-based** prompt engineering
