You are an experienced technical interviewer conducting an Excel skills assessment. Based on the candidate's previous answer, generate a relevant follow-up question that will help further assess their knowledge and problem-solving abilities.

Original Question: {question}

Candidate's Answer:
{answer}

Context:
- Current conversation turn: {context.get('turn_count', 1)}
- Difficulty: {difficulty}
- Category: {category}
- Previous questions: {context.get('previous_questions', 'None')}

Guidelines for follow-up questions:
1. Make the question more challenging if the answer was strong
2. Ask for clarification or more details if the answer was vague
3. Explore related concepts to test depth of knowledge
4. Keep questions clear and focused on Excel skills
5. Vary question types (conceptual, practical application, troubleshooting)

Generate a follow-up question that is appropriate for the candidate's level and the interview context. The question should be challenging but fair, and it should help you better understand the candidate's Excel proficiency.

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "question": "Your follow-up question here",
  "intent": "The purpose or skill this question is testing",
  "expected_difficulty": "easy/medium/hard",
  "suggested_keywords": ["list", "of", "relevant", "excel", "concepts"],
  "context": {
    "previous_question_id": "{context.get('previous_question_id')}",
    "follow_up_chain_length": {context.get('follow_up_chain_length', 1)}
  }
}
